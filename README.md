![Event Planner Screenshot](assets/event-planner-screenshot.png)


## Project Overview
diblo [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

**Project Name:** Eventure 
**Description:**  
The Event Planner app is a platform that allows users to create, manage, and track events and their attendees. Each user can organize multiple events, and each event can host multiple attendees. With secure login and role-based permissions, users can view, update, and manage their own events while giving attendees the ability to RSVP and update their invitation status. This structure supports both personal event planning and larger event management needs.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** sign-up, login, and logout functionality.
- **Event Management:** Users can create, view, update, and delete events.
- **Attendee Management:** Add and manage attendees for events, with attendees able to update their RSVP status.
- **Permissions:** Only users who create events can manage their details, and only attendees can edit their invitation status.
